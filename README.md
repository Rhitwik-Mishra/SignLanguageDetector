# SignLanguageDetector
Sign Detection Project This project is designed to detect and recognize hand signs using a deep learning-based approach. The model can recognize hand gestures and classify them into specific predefined sign language categories. This project utilizes computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect, process, and predict sign language gestures in real-time.

Table of Contents Overview Technologies Used Features Installation Usage Contributing License Overview The Sign Detection system aims to facilitate communication for people who rely on sign language. By using a webcam or camera, the system captures the hand signs and recognizes them using trained models. This can be used in various applications such as:

Real-time sign language recognition Translating gestures into text or speech Enhancing accessibility for people with speech impairments The project is built using the following technologies:

OpenCV: For image processing and hand detection. cvzone: For easier hand tracking and gesture recognition. MediaPipe: For accurate hand landmarks and pose estimation. TensorFlow: (If applicable) for training a deep learning model (or pre-trained models) to recognize specific signs. Technologies Used Languages: Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript Libraries: OpenCV, cvzone, mediapipe, TensorFlow (or Keras), NumPy Developer Tools: VS Code, PyCharm, Git, GitHub Features Real-time hand sign detection using a webcam. Display recognized signs in a graphical user interface (GUI). Customizable for different sign languages or gestures. Save detected gestures for future training. Support for continuous updates and improvements with deep learning models. Installation To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash Copy git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sign-Detection.git Install the required dependencies:

bash Copy pip install -r requirements.txt If you don't have requirements.txt, you can manually install these libraries:

bash Copy pip install opencv-python cvzone mediapipe tensorflow numpy Ensure your webcam or camera is connected and properly configured.

Usage Run the script for sign detection:

bash Copy python sign_detection.py The webcam will open, and it will start detecting hand signs. The system will classify and display the recognized sign.

Press s to save the detected gesture (if applicable).
